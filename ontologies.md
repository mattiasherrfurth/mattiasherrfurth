# On Ontologies
---
In the following corpus, I am referencing Google's 2nd definition of the term [ontology](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+ontology).

## Ontology - A set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.

Linguistics should fascinate all of us. We fall into comfortable phrases that describe a variety of concepts, then put our own spin on them. Each language and dialect can shape their prose at the collective and individual level, and they have always done so. This is found in professional environments, personal relationships, and other shared human experiences. We can also create our own ontologies for personal short-hands. I'll often describe a common concept ad-hoc by creating a new phrase like "that ship won't sail". If you are familiar with English, that will undoubtedly ring true to you, even if you don't know what it's talking about.

While I am not trying to patronize or insult the audience of this corpus, I will say that you don't have to have understood all of the previous paragraph. Instead, I will try to explain the confusing yet intricate idea that words like 'ontology' represent. I am concurrently writing this in an attempt to describe how I feel about the term 'ontology'.

I will try to use simple words, concepts, and analogies to describe various ontologies. When describing specific concepts, I may use an idiom or 'turn of phrase', which itself is an idiom (more recursion, and if pluralized, it would be 'turns of phrase'). An idiom is not exactly the words themselves, rather they are a reference to shared cultural knowledge of a specific concept. I am a native-born English speaker who was raised outside of Washington DC, in a Maryland suburb. I may not know another language fluently enough to converse, but I will try to use my past experience and current research to fill in any gaps of my knowledge. Lastly, some sentences may become very long, but I think it is important to show how flexible the language can be. I'll try to be concise.

The word 'ontology' also describes a collection of words that are all related to a specific domain of knowledge. Even the word 'domain' is used by many people in different professions. That means that 'domain' is a word shared across multiple ontologies.

Ontology is a word that describes itself, which is recursion. This is a linguistic joke in the English language, where terms become so amorphous and broad that they basically wrap around to reference themselves again. This is a common theme in all languages that I have encountered, wherein words and phrases are like umbrellas: they can cover a lot of space when opened up. We can call many things ontologies. The English dictionary is an 'ontology' of words in the English language. The English languages tries to contain many words from different cultures, and it is always expanding. Many ontologies do the same.

> :bulb: **Tip:** In other words, the word 'ontology' describes the word 'ontology'. It's weird, I know.

An analogy to this idea is the "double entendre", a phrase combining French and English, all sourced from proto-European languages. A double entendre describes when two words or phrases are similar, yet describe multiple concepts. The minimum concepts is two, hence 'double'. The word 'entendre' comes from Latin.

Language constantly evolves, no matter where you are. That is the beauty of professions like linguist, etymologist, and related liberal arts. I _would_ consider code development a liberal art, if it did not require so much knowledge of STEM. Coding can be very fun when you know what you're doing, but not fun when you don't understand the language (see 'double entendre', where most coding languages are written in English). Sometimes, even though they get confusing, languages need to have multiple ways to describe the **same thing**. There are many reasons for this that are outside the scope of this corpus.\t\r

The problem with 'ontology' is that it can be easily misused. Like any tool, each word can be used by one person and used differently by another. This can lead to miscommunication, where the audience does not fully understand the idea being described, yet both parties are speaking with the same ontolog(ies). Most people speak and write with ontologies that they are familiar with. It is easy to use words that are well-known. I will also make up words when it is fun to.

<center><!-- I especially like this part. --></center>

## The software industry has __<font color="orange">always</font>__ had different terms describing the same ideas.


> :warning: **Caution:** Please pay attention. There may an "error" or two.

It's important to understand that words are important. It is _not_ that words describe one _thing_, they describe *many things*. There are so many things that are described by common phrases. I love 'foo bar' almost as much as I love "fubar". The terms foo and bar don't mean anything. The term FUBAR describes when some thing is f---ed up beyond __any__ repair. They are the same sounds used for either no concept or bad concepts/ideas. These concepts \ ambiguities are both defensive and exciting. Many times, ontologies need to be both consistent and changing. Old words can still describe the same concept, but new words can describe them differently,..for better *or* for worse.

In other words, an 'ontology' that is niche can evolve fast in order to both accelerate the communication of concepts __and__ ensure that people in-the-know are agile to change. Change is constant and important, whether we want it or not.

I love the word ontology. I do not like the term 'ontology'. It means that 'corpusi' are __supposed__ to be consistent.

> :memo: **Stop Here:** Each corpus can **and** should be it's own challenge.

"And" is a powerful word, it joins two things. It can also hurt to have those things joined when you don't know how they are connected. With great power comes great responsibility.

Easter eggs are fun, anyone can enjoy a surprise inside a shell. We can ignore the shell and think of the surprise inside, **or** we can open it and learn about it. Pandora's Easter egg.
___

Premise: Everything is an ontology.

That premise itself is a tautology, which is another fun ology. We like ologies, generally; they help us to understand various knowledge. I want you to think about *when* and *if* a phrase can be understood in multiple ways. It hurts to think like that; it opens up too many possibilities. Then again, miscommunication can hurt more, it;s not fun __nor is it kind__. People miscommunicate __all__ the __time__. This is because we are human, we make mistakes. We are not robots, but that's okay. Machines are helpful and can be put to good use by the people who use them. If not, they can use us better.

### Man is <ins>not</ins> machine <ins>and</ins> man can use machine.

They just need to use them right.
