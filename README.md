# Hello, I'm Mattias!

## About Me

I'm a data professional with an engineering background and a passion for computer systems. I have knowledge across many STEM subjects and an eternal curiosity to learn more. I find computing systems endlessly interesting, and have used various flavors of Linux in order to enhance my understanding of operating systems and command lines. I have administrated Windows and Linux servers, SQL and NoSQL databases, and environments in AWS. I have many years of experience preprocessing and reporting data from enterprise warehouses, multi-domain networks, and serverless deployments in AWS GovCloud.

## Passion
I resonate deeply with [Clarke's three laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws), especially the third one: "<em>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</em>". We live in a world in which we interact with technology more complicated than any single one of us could imagine. I started my career in microelectronics before focusing on IT systems, and from both sides I can see how many domains of science came together to build these magical tools. Both the hardware and software are endless rabbit holes, ones that I find hard to resist delving into. I am passionate about the science, engineering, and overall evolution of computing systems.

Beyond computers, I am an enthusiast of all domains of science; I specialize in materials science, physics, chemistry, and optics. I have been able to apply this knowledge in my career, where I have worked in semiconductor fabrication and microelectronics assembly. I have spent time in various domains of engineering across the product lifecycle, from modeling and simulation to process engineering and quality control.

Aside from my technical interests and craft, I have varied interests in my personal time. I listen to several comedic and informational podcasts, mostly from the [Maximum Fun](https://maximumfun.org/) network. I love puzzles, building models, and yard work / gardening. My fiance and I love TV and movies in the genres of fantasy, drama, and sci-fi (and anime, which isn't exactly a genre, more like a medium unto itself). We also have two adorable cats named Merry and Pippin.
