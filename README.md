# Hello, I'm Mattias!

## About Me

I'm a data scientist with an engineering background and a passion for computer systems. I consider myself more of a generalist, with knowledge across many STEM domains and an eternal curiosity to learn more. Over the course of my career, I have deployed solutions such as automated SPC visualizations to drive corrective action, complex system architectures to deliver real-time data analytics, and standardized processes to enable high quality data storage. I am an enthusiast of all domains of science, specializing in materials science, electrical engineering, computing systems, and chemistry. I have spent time in many different areas of engineering across the product lifecycle, from modeling and simulation to process engineering and quality control.

My Bachelor's degree in Microelectronics Engineering, which exposed me to all the extremes of scientific achievements that enable the devices ubiquitous to our modern society. I received a Master's in Engineering Management, providing me insight into systems engineering and organizational principles. I received a Post-Baccalaureate degree in Data Science to round out and solidify my knowledge of statistical prin.
