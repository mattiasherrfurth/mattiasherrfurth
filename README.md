# Hello, I'm Mattias!

## About Me

I'm a data scientist with an engineering background and a passion for computer systems. I consider myself more of a generalist, with knowledge across many STEM domains and an eternal curiosity to learn more. Over the course of my career, I have deployed solutions such as automated SPC visualizations to drive corrective action, complex system architectures to deliver real-time data analytics, and standardized processes to enable high quality data storage. I am an enthusiast of all domains of science, specializing in materials science, electrical engineering, computing systems, and chemistry. I have spent time in many different areas of engineering across the product lifecycle, from modeling and simulation to process engineering and quality control.
