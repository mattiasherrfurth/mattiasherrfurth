# Hello, I'm Mattias!

## About Me

I'm a data professional with an engineering background and a passion for computer systems. I consider myself more of a generalist, with knowledge across many STEM domains and an eternal curiosity to learn more. I am an enthusiast of all domains of science, specializing in materials science, electrical engineering, computing systems, and chemistry. I have spent time in many different areas of engineering across the product lifecycle, from modeling and simulation to process engineering and quality control.
